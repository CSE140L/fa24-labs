# CSE 140L Repository

{: .note}
It isn't necessary to use the repository to complete the labs, but the repositories are structured to provide test cases and helpful tools to draw meaningful connections with your hardware circuits.

## Repository Structure

The lab repository is structured as a *mono-repository*.
This means that all the files, tests, simulation code, and documentation are all in one big monolithic repository.
For this quarter, the repository is available at [https://github.com/CSE140L/fa24-labs](https://github.com/CSE140L/fa24-labs).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, please ensure that `git` is installed on your system.
**Windows users, please use WSL for running anything in the repository.**

Then run the following in bash:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSE140L/fa24-labs ./CSE140L
cd CSE140L
```
