## Lore

In the bustling workshop of TickTok Incorporated, you, an eager apprentice, have been tasked with bringing the craft of timekeeping into the digital age.
No longer confined to the gears and springs of traditional clocks, your master has entrusted you with the mission of creating digital clocks using *Digital*.

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to familiarize you with *Digital* by implementing alarm clocks based on a variety of calendars.
Your task consists of three distinct parts, each building upon the last:

1. **The Conventional Alarm Clock**

2. **The French Republican Calendar Alarm Clock**

3. **The Extended French Republican Calendar Clock**

## Grading


## Conclusion
The craft of the digital clocksmith is both an art and a science. As you progress through this lab, you'll gain the skills necessary to not only design functional digital clocks but also to adapt them to complex and unconventional timekeeping systems. The challenge is yours to meetâ€”can you master the intricacies of time itself?
