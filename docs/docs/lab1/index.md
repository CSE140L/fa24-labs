## Lore

In the bustling workshop of a legendary clocksmith, you, an eager apprentice, have been tasked with bringing the craft of timekeeping into the digital age.
No longer confined to the gears and springs of traditional clocks, your master has entrusted you with the mission of creating digital clocks using *Digital*.

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to familiarize you with *Digital* by implementing alarm clocks based on a variety of calendars.
Your task consists of four distinct parts, each building upon the last:

1. **Part 1: Conventional Alarm Clock**
   - Your journey begins by designing a conventional alarm clock using *Digital*, and learning the basics of digital timekeeping.

2. **Part 2: French Republican Calendar Alarm Clock**
   - Next, you will tackle a more challenging task: implementing an alternative version of the alarm clock that conforms to the structure of the French Republican Calendar.

3. **Part 3: Extended French Republican Calendar Clock**
   - In this part, you will extend the alarm clock to keep track of the day of the week, week of the month, and month of the year in the French Republican Calendar.

4. **Part 4: Handling Extra Days in the French Republican Calendar**
   - Finally, you will complete the clock design by incorporating the handling of the 5 (or 6, in leap years) extra days that do not fit neatly into the standard calendar structure.

## Conclusion
The craft of the digital clocksmith is both an art and a science. As you progress through this lab, you'll gain the skills necessary to not only design functional digital clocks but also to adapt them to complex and unconventional timekeeping systems. The challenge is yours to meetâ€”can you master the intricacies of time itself?
