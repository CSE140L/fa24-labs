## Lore

In the bustling workshop of TickTok Incorporated, you, an eager apprentice, have been tasked with bringing the craft of timekeeping into the digital age.
No longer confined to the gears and springs of traditional clocks, your mentor has entrusted you with the mission of creating digital clocks using *Digital*.

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to familiarize you with *Digital* by implementing alarm clocks based on a variety of calendars.
Your task consists of three distinct parts, each building upon the last:

1. **The Conventional Alarm Clock**

2. **The French Republican Alarm Clock**

3. **The French Republican Calendar Alarm Clock**

## Lab Report

Please write a lab report that contains the following information:
- Your name and PID
- Pictures of your final circuits for each part (including embedded circuits)
- Answers to lab questions posed throughout the lab.
- Explanations on how you modified the circuit from Part 1 to the circuits in Part 2 and Part 3.
