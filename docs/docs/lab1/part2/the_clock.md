Your previous product (the *Conventional Alarm Clock*) was a overnight hit!
People were lining up around the doors (virtually on their phones) to order it from the TickTok shop.
Pleased with all the people you are waking up now, you decide to try something a little more radical.
Recently, TickTok has performed some user studies, and found that majority of Gen Z finds the current metric of keeping time to be very confusing.

Some user responses are provided below:
> Who in their right mind decided that 60 seconds was one minute?

> You know what else is 60? Boomers.

> Not as simple as a hundred, everything should be ðŸ’¯.

With your recent successes, the higher ups at TickTok have decided to let you perform some R&D on creating a new clock for Generation Alpha.
After your happy acceptance, you start realizing how difficult it is to create a new scale of time.
You decide to consult the classics, and hope someone before you had layed out some foundation that you can ~~copy~~ build on.
Thanks to the TickTok algorithm though, you were able to find traces of the "French Republican Calendar".

During the late 18th century (yes during the Reign of Terror), French revolutionaries attempted to create a calendar that introduced some sort of regularity.
While loading the next bourgeois sacrifice to the chopping block, revolutionaries were also busy modernizing calendars.
Joseph-Louis Lagrange was one of the proponents of the decimalisation movement in France at the time.

In their zeal for scientific precision, the French revolutionaries carried their love of the metric system which they propounded into the measurement of time.
The French Republican calendar was much more regular with every one of the 12 months being exactly 30 days which are divided into three ten-day weeks.
The deficit of 5 days at the end of each year (or 6 days in leap years) were designated as national holidays.
You decide to refer to these days of celebration as *complementary days* and jot down an idea on perhaps implementing it into another product later.
As far as the lower level time units were concerned, **each day was made up of ten decimal hours, each hour broken into 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute consisted of 100 decimal seconds**.

Happy with your research, you set off starting to build a French Republican Alarm Clock.


## Goals

1. Learn how to use *Digital*
2. Create a French Republican Calendar Alarm Clock 

## Instructions

All of your work should be in a new circuit called `FrenchRepublicanAlarmClock` (it will save as `FrenchRepublicanAlarmClock.dig`).

Unlike [Part 1](/docs/lab1/part1), the rest of this lab will have more discovery required on your part.
A great place to start would be to see how you can modify your `ConventionalAlarmClock` to fit the requirements for the `FrenchRepublicanAlarmClock`.
You may quickly realize that there the `BabylonianClock` component has inherent limitations, and can't simply reuse whatever your mentor has provided for you last.
It is up to you to implement the functionality of the `BabylonianClock` by yourself.
You can see how the `BabylonianClock` was implemented for inspiration by opening it in *Digital* or by checking out the [previous section](/docs/lab1/part1/provided_components#babylonianclock).

Remember, your final circuit should implement:
- The correct time functionality (outlined in **bold** in the lore above)
- The time setting logic
- The alarm setting logic
- The alarm buzzing logic
- The display functionality
