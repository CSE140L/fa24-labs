## Introduction

Our Boothâ€™s multiplier from Lab 2 had an obvious shortcoming.
Even though we could "skip" add operations during long strings of 1's or 0's in our multiplier, our circuit still performed the operation! (Though, the result of the operation was discarded on cycles where the add/sub wasn't needed.) 
The natural next step is to provide functionality to skip unnecessary add and subtract operations.
With your new expertise in finite state machines, it is now possible to design a new controller that can skip those operations! 

We ask that you implement the new controller twice: once as a Mealy machine and once as a Moore.

## Circuit Structure

{: .warning}
Failure to follow this structure can result in grading of the lab to be delayed or incorrect.

You will create four circuits for this part, `MealyController.dig`, `MooreController.dig`, and `BoothsMultiplierMealy.dig` and `BoothsMultiplierMoore.dig` that follows the same pinouts from Lab 2.

### Controller Pinout

{: .note}
We ask for `MULTIPLIER` and `MULTIPLICAND` inputs here, but this may not be the same as the `BoothsMultiplier`'s signals.
Aside from the FSM itself, this component shouldn't house any of the shift registers, this is a standalone controller that should be used in conjunction with your pre-existing multiplier logic.

| Port Direction | Port Name       | Active | Port Width (bits) | Description                                                             |

|     OUTPUT     | `EX_OP`         |  High  |                 1 | Denotes whether or not to perform an operation (Add/Subract)            |
|     OUTPUT     | `SHIFT`         |  High  |                 1 | Denotes whether or not to shift the partial sum                         |

|     OUTPUT     | `OP_DONE`       |    -   |                 2 | The operation you have performed (addition, subtraction, or no-op)      |
|     OUTPUT     | `DONE`          |  High  |                 1 | Set high when you have finished the multiplication                      |
