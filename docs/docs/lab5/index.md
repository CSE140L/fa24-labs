## Introdution

This lab assignment consists of four major sections.
In the first part, you will learn how to create a variety of flip-flops by construction transformation logic on a basic flip-flop.
In the second part of the lab, you will upgrade your Boothâ€™s multiplier datapath from Lab 2 to incorporate a hardwired controller that will reduce the number of clock cycles needed for the multiplication operation (so that you can finally see the speedup benefit of using Booth's multiplication).
Next, you will design and implement Mealy state machine controllers for a vending machine.
Finally, you will duplicate and minimize a pattern recognition Mealy machine and solve for the minimized next state logic.
All parts of this lab assignment will be completed in *Digital*.

We provide you a brief overview below of some of the relevant concepts explained in this lab before proceeding with an explanation of the actual lab assignment.

## Goals

The goal of this lab is to teach you how to build sequential logic.

## Lab Report

Please write a lab report that contains the following information:
- Your name(s) and PID(s)
- Pictures of your final circuits for each part (including embedded circuits)
- Answers to lab report questions

## Deliverables

Please submit the following files to Gradescope **individually**:

- All `.dig` files you have created 
- PDF of your [lab report](#lab-report)
