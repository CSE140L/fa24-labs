## Lore

This lab assignment consists of two parts.
In this first part, you will design and implement two versions of an excess-3 carry look-ahead adder, explore the carry look-ahead structure in this context, and then analyze and explore the timing paths through the separate versions.
In the second part, you will perform static hazard analysis and focus on the implementation of hazard-free circuits.

## Goals
The goal of this lab is to teach you how to build a carry-lookahead adder, analyzing critical paths, and calculating propogation delays.
Additionally, we want to ensure that you can design a hazard-free circuit.
